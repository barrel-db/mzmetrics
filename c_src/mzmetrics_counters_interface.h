/*
 * This is the interface to actually allocate memory for the counters.
 * Assuming that we will have two kinds of counter allocation
 * 1) pre-allocate a pool of memory and manage it
 * 2) allocate memory on the fly per resource
 * pcpu_counters implements 1 but doesn't have the memory management part
 * Implementing approach 2 is easier, going with it for now
 *
 * Another consideration is that for our use case it's better to have group of
 * counters rather than just one counter and having another wrapper around it.
